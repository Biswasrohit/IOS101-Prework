## App Idea: Study Planner with Gamification
I want to build an app combining study planning with gamification to motivate users. The app would allow users to:
- **Set Study Goals:** Define subjects, topics, and deadlines to cover.
- **Track Progress:** Visual progress trackers to show completed tasks.
- **Earn Rewards:** Users earn points for meeting goals, which can be used to unlock features like themes or avatars.
- **Collaborate:** Join study groups to share goals and motivate each other.

This app would be ideal for students looking for a way to manage their studies effectively while staying motivated.
